I recently started to reflect on my past experiences as a designer and pinpoint some of the issues I faced in my career. What I realized is that, in most cases, the issues stemmed from a lack of understanding and expectations at an organizational and systemic level.

More often than not, the challenges designers face could be avoided if there was a greater understanding of design, how it works, and how people should work together on it.

# Guiding principles

Below I've compiled a list of guiding principles that can provide a foundation for design in any organization. They focus on eliminating common challenges and educating teams on the best way to work with design in mind.

### Design is balance between logic and intuition

Design is balance, in every sense of the word. Effective design balances an array of colors, blocks of copy, images, and more into an easy-to-digest format. It balances sizes and visual relationships. It balances the message and the needs of the business with the needs of the viewer. And at the level of creation, it balances logic and intuition—the objective and the subjective.

What does this mean exactly? Glad you asked. It means that designers don't just make things without thought but, sometimes they do. Designers, whether they realize it or not, are making decisions while they work. And about half of these decisions are going to come from a place of logical thinking: "*I'm going to use this color blue because it's in our brand standards*" or "*I'll make this copy larger than the others so there's clear hierarchy in the layout.*"

It's important to understand this because there's often a tendency to dismiss these decisions in the review and feedback phase (more on this later). What we need to get from this is that there are decisions happening that are purely logical. They are guided by years of study, on-the-job learning, psychology, restrictions, rules, and principles that describe the best practices for effective design.

But, sometimes there are decisions being made that aren't logical and that's okay too. Designers, over time, start to develop a sense for making things look and feel "right." There isn't always a grand explanation for why they put the image on the left side or why chose the font they did—they just know that it feels right for the situation.

So does this mean the designer is right about all of the decisions they're making? No but, it does mean that the decisions are valid. And that's important. We, collectively, need to get rid of the notion that designers are just artists creating things for fun. Even if the decisions they make are coming from a place of intuition, they are still valid and play a valuable part in the process of design.

### Everyone deserves a seat at the table but, feedback should be a conversation

Okay, you now understand how a designer makes decisions but, you have some feedback on the presented design. It's important to note here that everyone should feel comfortable participating in the design process. Nothing good will ever come from a designer refusing to work with feedback. And on the other hand, nothing good will ever come from people consistently overriding the designer and turning feedback into direct orders.

Design feedback should be a conversation. Instead of saying "*change the blue color to red*" you might instead say "*I think the blue color should change to red because that's the color we've used for similar messages in the past.*" Now, the designer is able to process your feedback with a valid reason attached to it and decide a course of action. They can accept your feedback and make a change or come back with a reason of their own: "I get what you're saying, but I chose blue to intentionally break from our usual look to grab the viewer's attention." And this, of course, can go on and on.

The key here is that we (designers *and* those providing feedback) need to come prepared with our reasons—even if they're based on intuition. And we need to come prepared to listen to the reasons that others present to us. "*Blue just doesn't feel like the right color*" is valid as long as you're willing to listen to the reason blue was chosen in the first place.
